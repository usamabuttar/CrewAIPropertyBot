# Automating Real Estate Investment Research with CrewAI
This project dives into the world of building an AI-powered investment property bot using Crew AI, a platform designed for creating custom AI applications. But we're taking it a step further by utilizing Ollama, a powerful tool within Crew AI. 

Here's what you can expect to learn:

* The process of setting up and leveraging Crew AI, specifically focusing on Ollama, to construct your investment property bot.
* Techniques for harnessing Ollama's capabilities to automate real estate property searches and generate insightful reports. 
* A demonstration of the bot's functionalities, potentially showcasing how it identifies promising properties and analyzes relevant data using Ollama's features.

**Important Note:** *Building and running AI applications can involve significant computational resources. Consider utilizing a cloud-based platform with GPU acceleration for optimal performance.*

By following this project, you'll gain the knowledge to leverage Crew AI and Ollama to streamline your real estate investment research and potentially make informed investment decisions.
